<h1>Encoding Guidelines</h1>

<p>The <em>Chesnutt Archive</em> is experimenting with documenting our project's encoding guidelines in spreadsheet format, such that the encoding categories are more easily sortable and reorganized. It is possible that we will change to or supplement with a more explanatory, narrative form of guide in the future. The project's current guidelines can be found here: [LINK TO GOOGLE DOC?

<p>The encoding of the galley proofs presented the <em>Chesnutt Archive</em> with a unique challenge, in that the current TEI guidelines do not offer standards for the encoding of printed page proofs with handwritten corrections. The project team therefore developed an encoding scheme for these materials using existing TEI elements, work which we hope can serve as an example to other projects and individuals looking to digitize such materials. Ashlyn Stewart, Brett Barney, and Kevin McMullen played an early and ongoing role in the development of these guidelines, with the input of graduate research assistants Christy Hyman and Sam Gilmore, as well as the project co-directors. Because of the complexity of both the materials and the markup, the encoding guidelines for the galley proofs&#8212;including detailed explanations and examples&#8212;are documented separately from the other materials on the site, and can be viewed here: [LINK TO PDF OF GUIDELINES?]</p>
