<h1>Correspondence Catalog</h1>

<p>The table below is a catalog of all known correspondence to or from Charles W. Chesnutt, including draft lettersâ€”a resource which did not previously exist in Chesnutt scholarship. This catalog will be updated as new letters are discovered and users are encouraged to <a href="mailto:browners@newschool.edu;matt.cohen@unl.edu;kprice2@unl.edu">contact the project editors</a> if they are aware of a letter not represented here.</p>
